            <h1>Lissy Duncan - Running Coach</h1>
            <p>
                I’m an Australian representative distance runner with a passion for helping athletes reach their full potential.
                Over the years, I’ve competed for Australia in international events, including the World Championships and the World Cross Country Championships. 
                My experiences have taught me the importance of dedication, resilience, and smart training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I’m excited to share my knowledge and guide others through their running journey. Whether you're new to running or looking to take your performance to the next level, I provide personalized training plans to help you achieve your goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coaching is more than just improving physical performance — it’s about building mental strength, recovery, and balance. I love seeing runners I coach push their limits and become stronger, both mentally and physically.
