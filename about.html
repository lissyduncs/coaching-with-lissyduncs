            <h1>Lissy Duncan - Running Coach</h1>
            <p>
                I’m Lissy Duncan, an Australian representative distance runner with a passion for helping runners unlock their full potential through tailored training programs and personalised coaching. Having represented Australia on 11 occasions in both track and cross country; competing at the World Championships, Commonwealth Games, and earning Olympic selection, I’ve gained invaluable insights and experience that I now share with my athletes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every runner is unique, so I believe it’s essential to focus on the individual, working together to create a mindful, balanced approach that brings out the best in your running. Through my years of competing at the highest level, I’ve learned the importance of not only physical training but also the mental and emotional aspects that contribute to long-term success and enjoyment in the sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you’re just starting your running journey or looking to elevate your performance, I’m here to guide you with personalised training plans designed to help you achieve your goals in a healthy, sustainable way that fits your unique lifestyle. My mission is to share my experiences as an elite athlete, using them as a resource to inspire and empower you to find your passion and get the most out of your running.
            </p>
            <p>
